# Traffic-management-Program
ABSTRACT :->

-	Now-a-days the major accidents are occurred due to violation of traffic rules by vehicle users.
-	These accidents are mainly occurred because of the people who are crossing the junction before the signal and also we can see many of the people stopping their vehicles on or after zebra crossing which affects the path for pedestrians.     
-	Such an accidents can't prevented fully but can be reduced.
-	The following project helps to avoid the cautions mentioned above
This project is done through embedded c
The components required are given below
       Hardware :
•	ATMEGA 16 MICROCONTROLLER KIT
•	SEVEN SEGMENT LED DISPLAY
•	TRAFFIC LED LIGHT
•	BUZZER
•	MOTHER BOARD
•	CONNECTING WIRES


       SOFTWARE :
•	AVR  STUDIO PROGRAMMER
•	AVROSPLL ATMEGA 16 CONTROLLER DEBUGGER
working :->

- This project is to implement rules while traffic.
- It has a sensor which is used to detect the vehicles which are standing on or after zebra crossing.
- If there is any vehicle the sensor will gives the signal to microcontroller.
- Then the microcontroller gives the signal to the buzzer. Then buzzer gives beep signal as an alert signal.
-the above conditions are done when the Red light is in on state but not in any other conditions.
copy the code from the html document and compile it in "AVR  STUDIO PROGRAMMER,AVROSPLL ATMEGA 16 CONTROLLER DEBUGGER"
